That was the lowest figure over the observed period.  <b>Unemployment</b>   An unemployed person is defined as someone who is out of work and usually looking for work actively.

At the end of this period the issuer then returns the amount in full. Bonds differ from a regular loan through how they can be traded on financial markets once issued. This ability to trade bonds makes it more complex to measure the return investors receive from bonds, as the price they buy a bond for on the market may differ from the price the same bond was initially issued at. The yield is therefore calculated as what investors can expect to receive based on current market prices paid for the bond, not the value it was issued at. In total, <a href=\"/statistics/282647/government-debt-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UK government debt</a> amounted to over 2.4 trillion British pounds in 2023 \u2013 with the majority being comprised of different <a href=\"/statistics/1214074/composition-united-kingdom-government-debt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">types of UK government bonds</a>.  </p>\n<h2>Why are inverted yield curves important?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/statistics/1117437/monthly-average-yield-from-british-government-securities-by-nominal-par-yield/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">UK government bond yields over recent years</a> have taken on a typical shape, with short term bonds having a lower yield than bonds with a maturity of 10 to 20 years. The higher yield of longer-term bonds compensates investors for the higher level of uncertainty in the future. However, if investors are sufficiently worried about both a short term economic decline, and low long term growth, they may prefer to purchase short term bonds in order to secure assets with regular interest payments in the here and now (as opposed to shares, which can lose a lot of value in a short time). This can lead to an inverted yield curve, where shorter term debt has a higher yield. Inverted yield curves are generally seen as a reliable indicator of a recession, with <a href=\"/statistics/1087253/days-yield-curve-was-inverted-before-recession/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inverted yields occurring before most recent U.S. recessions</a>.

However, in comparison to the other emerging countries in the <a href=\"/statistics/254281/gdp-of-the-bric-countries/\">BRIC group</a>, India\u2019s progress was rather minimal. While China experienced the most apparent growth, India\u2019s efficiency and productivity remained somewhat stagnant over the course of 3 or 4 years. India also reported a rather large trade deficit over the past decade, implying that its total <a href=\"/statistics/254307/import-of-the-bric-countries/\">imports</a> exceeded its total amount of <a href=\"/statistics/254301/exports-of-the-bric-countries/\">exports</a>, essentially forcing the country to borrow money in order to finance the nation. Most economists consider trade deficits a negative factor, especially in the long run and for developing or emerging countries.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Since its introduction in October 2019, the Euro Short-Term Rate (\u20acSTR) has remained constant at between -0.51 and -0.59 percent until the second half 2022. Since then, it increased, peaking at 3.9 between the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. As of January 2025, the rate stood at 2.92 percent. The \u20acSTR is an interest rate benchmark designed to replace the\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/729345/eonia-money-market-annual-average-interest-rate-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Euro OverNight Index Average (EOIA)</a>, adopting a different calculation methodology that returns significantly lower rates. It is intended that the EOIA will be discontinued from January 3, 2022.  </p>\n<h2>How is the Euro Short-Term Rate calculated?</h2>\n<p>The \u20acSTR uses transaction data included in daily reporting on monetary exchanges from the 52 largest eurozone banks to calculate the average interests rate attached to loans throughout a business day. Only unsecured loans are included, as the rate on secured loans would be affected by the type of underlying collateral. Several key respects distinguish the \u20acSTR from alternative benchmarks like the EOIA, and the <a href=\"/statistics/247841/12-month-london-interbank-offered-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">London Intrabank Offered Rate (LIBOR)</a>. First, the \u20acSTR is based on transaction data alone, whereas the LIBOR asking major banks directly what rate they would charge other banks for short terms loans. The second main difference is that, by considering money market transactions rather than only intrabank lending (like the EOIA and LIBOR), the \u20acSTR incorporates the role of other major actors like money market funds, insurance companies, and other financial corporations.  </p>\n<h2>Difference between \u20acSTR and EURIBOR</h2>\n<p>The Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) is the other main reference interest rate governing eurozone lending. The EURIBOR differs from \u20acSTR though as it is based on a survey of the interest rates a panel of major banks would offer other major banks for interbank term deposits. There are therefore different reference rates published for different maturities, for example the <a href=\"/statistics/729368/euribor-money-market-one-month-average-interest-rate-eurozone-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EURIBOR one month rate</a>, the <a href=\"/statistics/729371/euribor-money-market-six-month-average-interest-rate-eurozone-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EURIBOR six month rate</a>, and the <a href=\"/statistics/729373/euribor-money-market-twelve-month-average-interest-rate-eurozone-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">EURIBOR 12 month rate</a>. In contrast, the \u20acSTR is intended to track the cost of overnight borrowing.</p>",

JPMorgan Chase's Tier 1 capital surpassed 278 billion U.S. dollars in the third quarter of 2024, cementing its position as the most well-capitalized bank in the United States.

However, in April 2019, Alcon\u2019s spin-off from Novartis was completed, making it a wholly independent company. With Sandoz, Novartis had also a strong generic drug division, until it was spun-off in mid-2023. Until 2014-2015, Novartis also had three other divisions which have since been sold: consumer health products, vaccines and diagnostics, and animal health. Thus, the company\u2019s development shows a clear focus on human medicine and innovative pharmaceuticals.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The global fintech landscape in 2024 continued to be dominated by North America, home to more than 12,000 financial technology companies, showing modest growth from 2023. Europe maintained its position as the second-largest fintech hub with over 9,200 companies, while the Asia-Pacific region hosted 6,365 fintechs. Though the sector experienced steady expansion from 2008 to 2024, the pace of new fintech formations noticeably slowed after 2021. In 2024, the United States reinforced its leadership in the industry by hosting approximately five times as many <a href=\"/statistics/1262201/number-of-fintech-unicorns-worldwide-by-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fintech unicorns</a> as the second-ranked United Kingdom.</p>\n<h2><b>Fintech investment landscape</b></h2>\n<p>Investment into the fintech sector grew sharply between 2010 and 2021, with <a href=\"/statistics/719385/investments-into-fintech-companies-globally/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global investment value</a> reaching an all-time high in 2021. After 2021, however, investment activity slowed down considerably. While the early slowdown may have been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the continued moderation in investment likely signals that the fintech sector is entering a more mature phase. This maturation is characterized by market consolidation, increased focus on profitability over growth, and more selective investment in proven business models rather than speculative ventures.</p>\n<h2>Leading fintech companies</h2>\n<p>Services provided by fintech companies have become deeply integrated into daily life, transforming how people manage money, make payments, and access financial services. While fintech companies operate globally, the United States and China have emerged as dominant hubs, together hosting eight of the world's ten <a href=\"/statistics/1262288/largest-fintech-companies-by-market-cap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">largest fintech companies</a> in 2024.

In order to set the wheels of an M&amp;A deal into motion, it is important to seek the services of an investment bank to facilitate the process. An <a href=\"/statistics/244774/leading-global-investment-banks-by-fee/\">investment bank</a> is a financial institution that has the capital to assist corporations, individuals and even governments in raising capital by acting as their client\u2019s agent in the issuance of securities.   The role of the investment bank in mergers and acquisitions can take one of two possible forms: target representation and acquirer representation, also known as seller and buyer representation respectively. Many companies who are looking to buy or sell their company in order to expand or streamline their business will normally use an investment bank for advice on possible targets or buyers - this will include a full valuation and recommended targets.   Often investment banks approach companies themselves to offer their services and pitch their own ideas regarding strategy for a possible merger or acquisition. Study of the market, valuation of the companies involved in the transaction or introduction of new securities to market in order to finance M&amp;A activity are one of the main roles an investment bank plays in the merger and acquisition process.</p>",

Mozambique, Malawi, Central African Republic, and Niger had <a href=\"/statistics/1226680/poverty-headcount-ratio-in-africa-by-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Africa\u2019s highest extreme poverty rates</a> based on the 2.15 U.S. dollars per day extreme poverty indicator (updated from 1.90 U.S. dollars in September 2022). Although the levels of poverty on the continent are forecast to decrease in the coming years, Africa will remain the poorest region <a href=\"/statistics/1226246/number-of-people-living-in-extreme-poverty-in-africa-compared-to-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">compared to the rest of the world</a>.   </p>\n<h2>Prevalence of poverty and malnutrition across Africa</h2>\n<p>Multiple factors are linked to increased poverty. Regions with critical situations of employment, education, health, nutrition, war, and conflict usually have larger poor populations. Consequently, poverty tends to be more prevalent in least-developed and developing countries worldwide. For similar reasons, rural households also face higher poverty levels. In 2024, the <a href=\"/statistics/1254364/poverty-headcount-ratio-in-africa-by-area-of-residence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">extreme poverty rate in Africa</a> stood at around 45 percent among the rural population, compared to seven percent in urban areas. Together with poverty, malnutrition is also widespread in Africa. Limited access to food leads to low health conditions, increasing the poverty risk. At the same time, poverty can determine inadequate nutrition. Almost 38.3 percent of the global <a href=\"/statistics/1305285/africa-s-share-of-global-undernourished-population/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">undernourished population</a> lived in Africa in 2022.</p>",

For Q4, 2024, the company reported revenues of some 17.8 billion U.S. dollars. That was significantly higher than 14.6 billion dollars in Q4 2023.\u00a0  </p>\n<h2>By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail</h2>\n<p>The majority of Pfizer\u2019s revenue comes from the manufacture and sale of its products. Pharmaceutical companies are always planning for the future, looking for ways to offset the impact felt when those products start to lose market exclusivity. The development of products is essential for the continued growth of the company, and investing in research and development (R&amp;D) is one way of identifying new, innovative medicines. Pfizer\u2019s <a href=\"/statistics/267810/expenditure-on-research-and-development-at-pfizer-since-2006/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">R&amp;D expenditure</a> stood at around 10.8 billion U.S. dollars in 2024.\u00a0  </p>\n<h2>Why Pfizer\u2019s revenues decreased until 2020?</h2>\n<p>Pfizer averaged quarterly revenues of around 13.2 billion U.S. dollars in the four years from the start of 2016 to the end of 2019 \u2013 this is considerably lower than the 16.7 billion U.S. dollars the company averaged per quarter in 2010. One reason for the decline was competition from generic drugs that entered the market when key patents expired. Pfizer lost the market exclusivity for its Lipitor product at the end of 2011, and <a href=\"/statistics/254341/pfizers-worldwide-viagra-revenues-since-2003/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">revenues were greatly affected</a> as a consequence. Additionally, following a review of its product portfolio, Pfizer\u2019s revenues were also impacted by the decision to spin off some of its business segments, such as its animal health division in 2013 and its Upjohn business in 2020.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Bitcoin dominance steadily declined in April 2024 to below 50 percent, amid rumors of central banks halting or potentially lowering interest rates in the future. Within the crypto world, this so-called \"dominance\" ratio is one of the oldest and most investigated metrics available. It measures the coin's market cap relative to the overall crypto market \u2014 effectively showing how strong Bitcoin compared to all the other cryptocurrencies that are not BTC, called \"altcoins\". Why dominance matters is because market caps of any crypto can change relatively quickly, either due to sudden price changes or a change of recorded trading volume. Essentially, the figure somewhat resembles a trading sentiment, revealing whether Bitcoin investors are responding to certain events or whether Bitcoin is losing out on <a href=\"/statistics/1269013/biggest-crypto-per-category-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">functions offered by, for example, stablecoins or NFT tokens</a>.</p>\n<h2>\"Dominance\" criticism: Ethereum and stablecoin</h2>\n<p>The interpretation of the Bitcoin metric is not without its criticism. When first conceived, Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to be created and had a substantial market share within all cryptocurrencies? The overall <a href=\"/statistics/1316465/top-five-stablecoin-market-distribution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">share of stablecoins, such as Tether, as well as Ethereum</a> increasingly start to resemble that of Bitcoin, however. Some analysts argue against this comparison. For one, they point towards the large influence of trading activity between Bitcoin and Ethereum in the dominance metric. Second, they argue that stablecoins can be traded in for Bitcoin and Ethereum, essentially showing how much investors are willing to engage with \"regular\" cryptocurrency.</p>\n<h2>A rally around Bitcoin in late 2023?</h2>\n<p>By December 2023, <a href=\"/statistics/326707/bitcoin-price-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the Bitcoin price</a> reached roughly 41,000 U.S. dollars \u2014 the first time in 20 months such a value was reached. A weaker U.S. dollar, speculation on decreasing interest rates, and a potential Bitcoin ETF approval are believed to be at the heart of this price increase. Whether this will hold in 2024 is unclear: The <a href=\"/statistics/187616/effective-rate-of-us-federal-funds-monthly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">monthly interest rate from the U.S. Fed</a> is speculated to decrease in 2024, despite a vow of \"higher for longer\".

    "description": "<p>The average agreed rent for new tenancies in the UK ranged from 665 British pounds to 2,100 British pounds, depending on the region. On average, renters outside of London paid 1,095 British pounds, whereas in London, this figure amounted to 2,025 British pounds. Rents have been on the rise for many years, but the period after the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated this trend. Since 2015, the <a href=\"/statistics/285697/great-britain-monthly-index-of-private-housing-rental-prices-iphrp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average rent in the UK increased</a> by about 25 percent, with about half of that gain achieved in the period after the pandemic.</p>\n<h2>Why have UK rents increased so much?</h2>\n<p>One of the main reasons driving up rental prices is the declining affordability of homeownership. Historically, house prices grew faster than rents, making renting more financially feasible than buying. In 2022, when the <a href=\"/statistics/592108/house-price-to-rent-ratio-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">house price to rent ratio index peaked,</a> house prices had outgrown rents by nearly 30 percent since 2015. As house prices peaked in 2022, home buying slowed, exacerbating demand for rental properties and leading to soaring rental prices.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>How expensive is too expensive?</h2>\n<p>Although there is no official requirement about the <a href=\"/statistics/752217/household-rent-to-income-ratio-by-region-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">proportion of income spent on rent </a>for it to be considered affordable, a popular rule is that rent should not exceed more than 30 percent of income. In 2024, most renters in the UK exceeded that threshold, with the southern regions significantly more likely to spend upward of 30 percent of their income on rent. Rental affordability has sparked a move away from the capital to other regions in the UK, such as the South East (Brighton and Southampton), the West Midlands (Birmingham) and the North West (Liverpool, Manchester, Blackpool and Preston).</p>",

It is estimated that more than 36 percent of adult Americans are obese. Thus, the preconditions for a drug like Wegovy are more than just a given. This is also reflected in Novo Nordisk's increasing share prices and a currently record-high market capitalization.  </p>\n<h2>The risks of weight loss drugs</h2>\n<p>Wegovy seems to cut the risks of certain conditions that usually come with overweight and obesity, like stroke and heart attack. But of course, there are also risks that must be considered. The most common side effects of the drugs are nausea, dizziness, diarrhea, and vomiting. Doctors also warn that weight loss drugs like Wegovy can lead to serious complications for patients who need anesthesia for surgery when the stomach must be completely empty. There is an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration since these drugs slow down digestion. Another problem weight loss drugs can cause is that people, instead of changing their lifestyle and mostly out of convenience, immediately turn to such drugs.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Across the major European industrial and logistics real estate markets, London had the highest rental rate in 2024. One square meter in a large, prime warehouse in London cost about 323 euros annually in the fourth quarter of the year. That figure reflects the rental cost after any rent-free periods or incentives, excluding taxes and charges, referred to as headline rent. Other markets with high rental rates were Helsinki and Oslo.</p>\n<h2>What are the most important logistics hubs in Europe?</h2>\n<p>London\u2019s domestic and international connectivity, thriving business ecosystem, and access to a large consumer base make it one of the most important logistics hubs in Europe. Nevertheless, Birmingham <a href=\"/statistics/933094/take-up-of-warehouses-over-five-thousand-square-meter-in-europe-by-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">achieved the highest take-up among the major European markets for three years in a row</a>. Birmingham is part of the UK\u2019s golden logistics triangle \u2013 an area between Birmingham, Northamptonshire, and Yorkshire that, due to its central location, is within a four-hour drive from 90 percent of the British population. Unsurprisingly, Europe\u2019s three largest economies (the UK, Germany, and France) <a href=\"/statistics/527988/industrial-and-logistics-investment-in-real-estate-by-country-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">had the most active logistics investment markets</a>. Combined, the three countries accounted for more than half of the total investment value in the sector.</p>\n<h2>How profitable is warehouse investment in Europe?</h2>\n<p>One of the key metrics for measuring the profitability of an investment is yield, or the rental income generated by the property as a percentage of its price. In Europe, yields for prime properties reached up to eight percent, but some markets, such as France and Germany, <a href=\"/statistics/986966/net-prime-yields-by-country-warehouses-in-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">experienced much lower yields</a>. Though low yields can be interpreted as low profitability, they are usually a sign of strong market fundamentals and sentiment. In conditions of economic growth and steady occupier demand, investors can expect rental and capital growth and are more willing to accept lower yields. On the other hand, when the macroeconomic conditions deteriorate, economic growth slows down, and borrowing costs increase, investors address the higher risk through higher yields.</p>",

In the fiscal year ending December 31, the multinational e-commerce company's net revenue was almost 638 billion U.S. dollars, up from 575 billion U.S. dollars in 2023. Amazon.com, a U.S. e-commerce company originally founded in 1994, is the world\u2019s largest online retailer of books, clothing, electronics, music, and many more goods. As of 2024, the company generates the majority of it's\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/672747/amazons-consolidated-net-revenue-by-segment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">net revenues through online retail product sales</a>, followed by third-party retail seller services, cloud computing services, and retail subscription services including Amazon Prime.   </p>\n<h2>From seller to digital environment</h2>\n<p>Through Amazon, consumers are able to purchase goods at a rather discounted price from both small and large companies as well as from other users. Both new and used goods are sold on the website. Due to the wide variety of goods available at prices which often undercut local brick-and-mortar retail offerings, Amazon has dominated the retailer market. As of 2024, <a href=\"/statistics/267870/brand-value-of-the-leading-20-most-valuable-retailers-worldwide/\">Amazon\u2019s brand worth</a> amounts to over 185 billion U.S. dollars, topping the likes of companies such as Walmart, Ikea, as well as digital competitors Alibaba and eBay. One of Amazon's first forays into the world of hardware was its e-reader Kindle, one of the most popular e-book readers worldwide. More recently, Amazon has also released several series of own-branded products and a voice-controlled virtual assistant, Alexa.   </p>\n<h2>Headquartered in North America</h2>\n<p>Due to its location, Amazon offers more services in North America than worldwide. As a result, the <a href=\"/statistics/266289/net-revenue-of-amazon-by-region/\">majority of the company\u2019s net revenue</a> in 2023 was actually earned in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.

The CPI is defined by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics as \"a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\" To calculate the CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics considers the price of goods and services from various categories: housing, transportation, apparel, food &amp; beverage, medical care, recreation, education and other/uncategorized. The CPI is a useful measure, as it indicates how the <a href=\"/topics/768/cost-of-living/\">cost of urban living in the United States</a> has changed over time, compared to a base period. CPI is also used to calculate <a href=\"/statistics/191077/inflation-rate-in-the-usa-since-1990/\">inflation</a>, or change in the purchasing power of money.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. urban CPI has been rising steadily since 1992. As of 2023, the CPI was 304.7, up from 233 ten years earlier and up from 184 twenty years earlier. This indicates the extent to which, compared to a base period 1982-1984 = 100, the price of various goods and services has risen.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Vacancy rates across the office real estate sector in the U.S. remained stable in 2024. However, those figures increased nearly every quarter between early 2020 and late 2023. Before 2020, the quarterly vacancy rate was around 12 percent, but as the pandemic unfolded, it climbed to above 15 percent. In the 2nd quarter of 2024, about 17.6 ercent of office space across the country was vacant. In some of the major U.S. markets,\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/605467/vacancy-rate-in-large-office-metros-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">vacancies reached 24 percent and over</a>.

The function of the office has evolved from the primary workplace to a space where employees collaborate, exchange ideas, and socialize. That has shifted occupiers\u2019 attention toward spaces with modern designs that can accommodate the office of the future. Many businesses used the pandemic time to revisit their office guidelines, remodel or <a href=\"/statistics/1340283/office-fit-out-cost-north-america-by-city/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">do a full or partial fit-out</a>.

In fact, it was first called CVS Corporation, which was then changed to CVS Caremark Corporation and finally to CVS Health Corporation.

Throughout these fluctuations, the <a href=\"/statistics/412622/value-of-global-fintech-investment-by-region/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Americas consistently attracted the majority of investments</a>, representing over half of the total global investment volume.</p>\n<h2>Fintech revolution: North America lead the charge</h2>\n<p>Fintech refers to innovative startups in the financial sector that leverage modern technology to revolutionize financial services. These companies develop digitally enhanced products, offering widespread access to financial services at lower costs compared to traditional institutions. Their solutions often improve efficiency, accessibility, and user experience in various financial operations. As of 2024, the North America led the\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/893954/number-fintech-startups-by-region/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global fintech landscape</a> with over 12,000 fintech businesses, establishing the region as the world's premier hub for financial technology innovation.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Which is the largest fintech unicorn in the U.S.?</h2>\n<p>In 2024, Stripe, a San Francisco-based payment processing services company, led the U.S. fintech unicorn sector with a valuation of 65 billion U.S. dollars. This positioned Stripe as the <a href=\"/statistics/1130150/biggest-fintech-companies-value-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most valuable fintech company in the United States</a>. Following Stripe was Chime, another significant player in the fintech space, valued at 25 billion U.S. dollars. The substantial valuations of these companies underscore the growing importance and financial clout of innovative payment and banking solutions in the U.S. financial technology landscape.</p>",

They are further classified as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and slow moving consumer goods (SMCG). FMCG are goods with a lifespan shorter than a year. Popular categories include food and beverages, personal care and household products, clothing and apparel, tobacco, and pet food/pet care. These categories are bought quite frequently with recurring expenditure. In contrast to SMCG, the products tend to be sold high in volume, but low in cost. FMCG are also known as Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG).   </p>\n<h2>FMCG companies</h2>\n<p>The FMCG environment is highly competitive as FMCG companies are always on the hunt for the next great product discovery or innovation in order to meet consumer\u2019s needs. Some of the leading key players of the FMCG environment include <a href=\"/topics/1439/nestle/\">Nestl\u00e9</a>, <a href=\"/topics/1625/procter-and-gamble/\">Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G)</a>, Unilever, PepsiCo and the <a href=\"/topics/1392/coca-cola-company/\">Coca-Cola Company</a>. All of them operate internationally and have to try to meet country-specific requirements regarding product packaging and labeling. Their million dollar brands can be found in many household pantries. In order to keep consumers as regular buyers, CPG companies try to develop loyalty and trust towards their brands. Ariel, Gillette, Pampers and <a href=\"/statistics/289870/usage-frequency-of-pantene-pro-v-shampoo-in-the-us/\">Pantene</a> are considered to be among the most famous brands of P&amp;G.  </p>",

The pharmaceutical sector represents a huge industry, with the global market being worth around 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars. Among the best known <a href=\"/statistics/265940/leading-pharmaceutical-companies-by-prescription-sales-and-rundd-spending/\">top global pharmaceutical companies</a> are Pfizer, Merck and Johnson &amp; Johnson from the U.S., Novartis and Roche from Switzerland, Sanofi from France, etc. Accordingly, North America and Europe are still among the largest global submarkets for pharmaceuticals.   In 2024, the United States was still the largest single pharmaceutical market, generating more than 760 billion U.S. dollars of revenue. Europe was responsible for generating around 280 billion U.S. dollars. These two markets, together with Japan, Canada and Australia, form the so-called established (or developed) markets. The rest of the <a href=\"/statistics/266039/global-pharmaceutical-market-revenues/\">global pharmaceutical revenue</a> is mainly from emerging markets, which include countries like China, Russia, Brazil and India. In fact, these emerging markets show the fastest increase in pharmaceutical sales. Latin America is the world region with the highest predicted compound annual growth rate until 2028.</p>",

The rise in natural gas and coal prices, exacerbated by the economic recovery post-COVID-19 and the Ukraine conflict, further contributed to the spike. Despite Germany's progress in renewable <a href=\"/statistics/736640/energy-mix-germany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy sources</a>, with over 50 percent of gross electricity generated from renewable sources in 2023, the country still relies heavily on fossil fuels.

As of April 1, 2024, households with basic supplier contracts were paying around 46 cents per kilowatt-hour, making it the most expensive option compared to other providers or special contracts. The breakdown of <a href=\"/statistics/1050578/household-electricity-prices-by-supplier-type-germany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">household electricity prices</a> in 2023 showed that supply and margin, along with energy procurement, constituted the largest controllable components, amounting to 40.6 and 11.6 euro cents per kilowatt-hour, respectively.

While 120 ships were attacked by pirates in 2023, the number of ships attacked dropped to 116 in 2024.\u00a0  <b> Pirate attacks </b>   Although the term \u201cpirate\u201d may conjure up images of bearded men with eye patches, wooden legs and parrots who were convicted and buried centuries ago, <a href=\"/topics/1290/pirate-attacks/\">pirate attacks </a>are indeed posing a threat to today\u2019s <a href=\"/topics/1367/container-shipping/\">shipping </a>lines all over the world.   Contemporary maritime piracy reached its peak level in 2010, with around 445 reported incidents. The regions most likely to come under threat from pirate attacks include Indonesia, the Malaysia, and Nigeria. Here, pirates are attracted by the abundance of natural resources in the countries themselves or in adjacent areas. Strategic passages for oil transport such as Bab-el-Mandeb, near Somalia, or the Strait of Malacca off the Indonesian coast have become notorious targets for maritime crime. In 2013, oil tankers shipped 15.2 million barrels of <a href=\"/statistics/271566/transit-choke-points-on-oil-transportation-routes-in-2009/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oil per day</a> through the Strait of Malacca; this exceeds the daily volume of oil imported into the whole of the <a href=\"/topics/921/european-union/\">European Union</a>. With oil prices hovering around 70 U.S. dollars per barrel in 2018, the hijacking of a crude oil tanker sounds like a promising deal for pirates. In 2017, Venezuela was thrust into the limelight: Here, the number of incidents rose from five to 12 between 2016 and 2017.   It is often the crew and the pirates themselves who pay most dearly for maritime crime. In Somali waters, at least 149 crew members were held hostage in 2011, and over 100 pirates were killed - mostly by naval forces such as armed guards, who are increasingly seen to be of central importance to the protection of merchant ships.</p>",

For example, the code lists data fetching commands associated with Uniswap and Aave \u2014 two <a href=\"/statistics/1296148/defi-market-cap-of-various-protocols/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DeFi protocols with a market cap that was higher than one billion U.S. dollars</a> in March 2022.

The amount of money stored in Decentralized Finance was worth about 50 billion U.S. dollars by November 2023, compared to 175 billion U.S. dollars at the end of 2021. Two reasons can be named for this decline. First, the overall cryptocurrency markets has witnessed several dramatic moments. Prices declined after the crash of stablecoin LUNA, and the sudden collapse of crypto exchange FTX in 2022. In 2023, the United States government handed out one of its largest ever corporates fines to Binance \u2014 the world's largest crypto exchange. Second, analysts believe the <a href=\"/statistics/247565/monthly-average-10-year-us-treasury-note-yield-2012-2013/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">high yield on U.S. Treasury bonds</a> in 2023 when compared to DeFi yields negatively impacted the young industry \u2014 as these bonds pose lower risk than DeFi.</p>\n<h2>DeFi use cases: Supporting crypto investments</h2>\n<p>Decentralized Finance hopes to offer different digital financial services, which are run by a community in a so-called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) away from banks or governments. These services can include asset management, money lending, or trading, potentially making it possible to offer services that traditional finance cannot do. By late 2023, however, <a href=\"/statistics/1292970/defi-market-size-by-segment-usd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DeFi focused on two main use cases</a>: Liquid staking and money lending. These processes are there to support crypto investors, specifically. The market size of insurance within Decentralized Finance, for example, was much smaller in comparison.</p>",

Despite being only available in Mandarin, U.S. downloads of the Instagram-like photo and social app were 509,000\u00a0 n the last quarter of 2024, and amounted to approximately 3.7 million in the first quarter of 2025. The app, which presents a visual format and functions similar to TikTok, including vertical scrolling, has seen Chinese-based audiences and U.S. audiences interact in new and unforeseen ways, such as language exchanges.</p>\n<h2>The U.S. TikTok ban</h2>\n<p>In April 2024, U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan bill ordering the sale of TikTok and its separation from ByteDance, or a ban on the entire platform within the U.S. market in case TikTok failed to comply. U.S. users choosing Xiaohongshu was a particularly surprising move, as previous <a href=\"/statistics/1465222/tiktok-content-creator-alternative-social-media-due-ban/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">surveys suggested different consumer preferences in case TikTok was banned</a>. Traditional social media and video platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram were given as the possible winners of a TikTok ban. While Xiaohongshu might not be the platform U.S. TikTok users and content creators might choose in the future, consumers in the region have shown that alleged privacy issues specific to Chinese-developed technology are not their major concern. Overall, over 10 countries and regions worldwide opted for <a href=\"/statistics/1381501/tiktok-ban-partial-full-global-regions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banning TikTok on government-owned devices</a>, while only Afghanistan and India opted for a full app ban.</p>\n<h2>Xiaohongshu vs Douyin in China</h2>\n<p>Differently from TikTok and Douyin (its original version accessible only in the Chinese market), which are two separate entities and do not operate within the same audiences, content management principles, and even terms of use on what the platforms allow, Xiaohongshu presents only one interface. While Douyin was the third <a href=\"/statistics/1362767/china-leading-apps-based-on-user-traffic-value/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">most-valuable app based on user traffic value</a> in China in 2024, Xiaohongshu ranked tenth with a user traffic value of 27 billion yuan. In terms of content creators, <a href=\"/statistics/1473426/china-influencer-distribution-on-major-social-media-by-tier-level/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xiaohongshu hosted more micro creators</a> (with up to 500,000 followers) and fewer Key Opinion Leaders in 2023, while Douyin had a relatively smaller micro-creators base.\u00a0</p>",

However, 2023, saw a massive increase up to 30.5 billion dollars, mostly due to higher charges for business development transactions and increased development spending particularly in the therapeutic areas of oncology, cardiovascular, infectious diseases and vaccines.\u00a0  </p>\n<h2>Finding a cure for rising research costs</h2>\n<p>To increase the quality of its innovation, Merck &amp; Co. has entered into arrangements with other companies, and lower payments made to its collaborative partners was one reason for the reduction in R&amp;D costs in 2018.

It reflects the performance of 30 of the most influential U.S. based companies from various industries, such as <a href=\"/statistics/422930/market-capitalization-jpmorgan-chase/\">JPMorgan Chase</a>, <a href=\"/topics/1325/ibm/\">IBM</a> and <a href=\"/topics/1824/disney/\">Walt Disney</a> traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ.   </p>\n<h2>Performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average</h2>\n<p>The year that the financial crisis unfolded, 2008, was one of the <a href=\"/statistics/261787/the-worst-years-of-the-dow-jones-index-since-1897/\">worst years of the Dow</a>.

Meanwhile, philosphy, history, and agriculture, as well as biolological engineering, textile, and water resources were among the least desirable subjects. However, even the popular, highly competitive fields of study do not always guarantee quick and successful employment after graduation.\u00a0  </p>\n<h2>What are the labor market prospects for graduates?</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/statistics/280947/employment-rate-of-university-graduates-in-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">graduate employment rate</a> within half a year after graduation has been generally stable in China over the past seven years, exceeding 90 percent on average. Those that struggle to find a job are usually graduates from less technical, quantitative majors who often lack both practical \u201chard skills\u201d and \u201csoft skills\u201d such as communication, critical thinking, and managerial abilities. Engineering, technology, IT and science majors top employment rates as well as secure higher-starting salaries. The <a href=\"/statistics/252912/monthly-salary-of-university-graduates-in-china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">average monthly salary of a university graduate</a> in China has increased by around 70 percent in the last ten years. However, high rent and costs of living in cities like Beijing or Shanghai often force young graduates to return to their hometowns or to seek employment in the second and third tier cities.</p>",

Although not a pure play biotech firm, Roche from <a href=\"/statistics/272104/swiss-biotech-companies-profit-since-2007/\">Switzerland</a> is among the leaders by revenues from biotech therapies worldwide. In contrast, California-based company Amgen is the world\u2019s largest pure-play biotech company. Amgen made over 33 billion U.S. dollars of revenue in 2024.\u00a0  Biotech companies use biotechnology to generate their products, most often medical drugs or agricultural genetic engineering. The latter segment was dominated by Monsanto, <a href=\"/statistics/263786/revenue-of-bayer-ag-by-segment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">nowadays a part of Bayer CropScience</a>. The United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity defines biotechnology as follows: \"Any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use.\" In fact, biotechnology is thousands of years old, used in agriculture, food manufacturing and medicine.</p>",

As even the definition of terrorism is hotly debated, it is essential to highlight that the methodologies used to measure terrorism are also contested. The Global Terrorism Index ranks 163 countries on four indicators weighted over five years. These four factors are: the number of terrorist incidents per year, the number of fatalities caused by terrorists per year, the number of injuries caused by terrorists per year, and total property damage caused by terrorism per year.</p>\n<h2>Terrorist groups</h2>\n<p>Terrorism comes in several forms from a variety of groups with differing intentions. <a href=\"/statistics/937553/terrorism-most-active-perpetrator-groups-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Taliban</a> regaining power in Afghanistan in 2021 can help explain the high ranking of Afghanistan, but the country has been plagued by terrorist activities for many decades. The operation of numerous groups alongside or in conflict with the <a href=\"/topics/3412/islamic-state-isis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Islamic State</a> and the Taliban has led to Afghanistan falling victim to a high number of attacks. Moreover, IS now operates across several countries and regions, including in Burkina Faso.</p>\n<h2>Economic damages</h2>\n<p>On the non-human casualty side of the index, property loss is an important metric as loss of shelter or livelihood has a long lasting impact on those who survive the attack physically unharmed. The high percentage of attacks in advanced economies in the <a href=\"/statistics/276731/most-expensive-terrorist-attacks-based-on-insured-damage-since-1970/\">most expensive terrorist attacks by insured property loss</a> demonstrates the limitation of using comparative financial data.

Since then there have been many significant fluctuations to this number - the 2008 financial crisis left millions of people without work, as did the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of 2022 and throughout 2023, the unemployment rate came to 3.6 percent, the lowest rate seen for decades. However, 2024 saw an increase up to four percent. For monthly updates on unemployment in the United States visit either the monthly national unemployment rate\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/273909/seasonally-adjusted-monthly-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, or the monthly state unemployment rate <a href=\"/statistics/200017/state-unemployment-rate-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. Both are seasonally adjusted.   <b>Unemployment</b>  Unemployment is defined as a situation when an employed person is laid off, fired or quits his work and is still actively looking for a job. Unemployment can be found even in the healthiest economies, and many economists consider an unemployment rate at or below five percent to mean there is 'full employment' within an economy. If former employed persons go back to school or leave the job to take care of children they are <a href=\"/statistics/192417/inactive-labor-force-of-the-us-since-1990/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">no longer part of the active labor force</a> and therefore not counted among the unemployed.   Unemployment can also be the effect of events that are not part of the normal dynamics of an economy. Layoffs can be the result of technological progress, for example when robots replace workers in automobile production. Sometimes unemployment is caused by job outsourcing, due to the fact that employers often search for cheap labor around the globe and not only domestically. In 2022, the <a href=\"/topics/10370/tech-sector-layoffs/#topicOverview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tech sector in the U.S. experienced significant lay-offs</a> amid growing economic uncertainty.

    "description": "<p>A comparison of standardized ESG scores of the 27 largest insurance companies in the world shows significant differences between ESG score providers in many cases. The world's largest insurer by market capitalization, UnitedHealth, saw the largest range of scores, with S&amp;P rating the company with the score of 44 out of 100 (indicating the company has a high level of ESG risk), while Sustainalytics awarded the equivalent score of 16.6 out of 100 (indicating a low average level of ESG risk). MSCI was somewhere in the middle, awarding a score which was the equivalent of 64.3. However, there was also some degree of convergence between the three ESG score providers as well. For example, all three companies awarded high ESG scores (indicating low risk) to most of the large European insurers such as Allianz,\u00a0Munich Re, AXA, and Zurich Insurance Group.\u00a0  <b>What do ESG scores mean?</b>  Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores are a vital investor tool used to assess a company's sustainability and ethical performance.

In 2021, a survey was carried out to determine <a href=\"/statistics/1312784/investors-satisfaction-with-esg-reporting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">investor satisfaction with the quality of ESG reporting</a> globally.

The decline follows after Binance and Coins - two of <a href=\"/statistics/864738/leading-cryptocurrency-exchanges-traders/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the biggest crypto exchanges in the world</a> - received lawsuits in the United States. Observations are also that the crypto market was quiet after April, citing a lack of a \"strong overarching narrative\".

    "description": "Bitcoin is edging closer to reaching its finite, maximum supply, pushing its price up and making it harder to mine. As a rule of thumb, the fewer coins available to the general audience, the higher the value of the cryptocurrency becomes. No more mining is possible when a cryptocurrency reaches its maximum supply. The market price then reflects supply and demand. Bitcoin has a set limit of 21 million coins, the last of which is to be mined around the year 2140 according to a 2017 forecast - with the assumption that <a href=\"/statistics/793539/bitcoin-transaction-confirmation-time/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the rate of Bitcoin mining halves every four years</a>.\r\n\r\n  <h2>Why are there so many differences in crypto supply?</h2>\r\n\r\nCryptocurrency developers can determine whether a coin should have a fixed limit, depending on the blockchain it utilizes or monetary strategies. <a href=\"/statistics/1278169/ethereum-circulating-supply/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum has no maximum supply</a>, meaning miners can create and indefinitely extract this cryptocurrency. This is called an inflationary cryptocurrency, one that continuously inflates the supply. The idea is that the number of tokens in circulation keeps outpacing demand, decreasing overall value. Some coins limit the release of their (indefinite) supply or even destroy (burn) tokens. <a href=\"/statistics/1317271/luna-burn-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Such deflationary events took place with LUNA</a> in 2022.\r\n\r\n  <h2>The appeal of low-supply cryptocurrency for investors</h2>\r\n\r\nCrypto investors tend to be on the lookout for crypto with limited supply, ideally with low levels. After a token reaches maximum supply, the argument goes, the coin's supply becomes static - miners can no longer create new coins. The demand should continue to grow. A maximum cap, they hope, guarantees value gains. Not many such coins exist. <a href=\"/statistics/1298710/daily-tvl-of-aave-defi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DeFi platform AAVE</a> is an example of a cryptocurrency with a max supply smaller than 100 million.",

Although food and energy prices came down quite sharply in 2023, underlying\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/1317058/uk-core-inflation-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">core inflation</a>, which measures prices rises without food and energy, remained slightly above the headline inflation rate throughout 2024, suggesting some aspects of inflation had become embedded in the UK economy.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Inflation rises across in the world in 2022</h2>\n<p>The UK was not alone in suffering from runaway inflation over the last few years. From late 2021 onwards, various factors converged to encourage a global acceleration of prices, leading to the ongoing <a href=\"/study/116987/the-inflation-crisis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflation crisis</a>. Blocked-up supply chains were one of the main factors as the world emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed by energy and food inflation skyrocketing after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Central bank\u00a0<a href=\"/chart/26131/central-bank-interest-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">interest rates</a> were raised globally in response to the problem, possibly putting an end to the era of cheap money that has defined monetary policy since the financial crash of 2008.</p>",

This followed 2022, when RPI inflation reached a rate of 11.6 percent, by far the highest annual rate during this provided time period.</p>\n<h2>CPI vs RPI</h2>\n<p>Although the Retail Price Index is a commonly utilized inflation indicator, the UK also uses a newer method of calculating inflation, the Consumer Price Index. The CPI, along with the <a href=\"/statistics/310582/uk-cpih-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPIH</a> (Consumer Price Index including owner occupiers' housing costs) are usually preferred by the UK government, but the RPI is still used in certain instances. Increases in <a href=\"/statistics/305000/national-rail-revenue-from-ordinary-and-season-ticket-passenger-fares-in-the-united-kingdom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rail fares</a> for example, are calculated using the RPI, while increases in pension payments are calculated using CPI, when this is used as the <a href=\"/statistics/1445915/uk-pension-growth/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">uprating factor</a>. The use of one inflation measure over the other can therefore have a significant impact on people\u2019s lives in the UK.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>High inflation falls to more typical levels by 2024</h2>\n<p>Like the Retail Price Index, the Consumer Price Index <a href=\"/statistics/306648/inflation-rate-consumer-price-index-cpi-united-kingdom-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflation rate</a> also reached a recent peak in October 2022. In that month, prices were rising by 11.1 percent and did not fall below double figures until April 2023. This fall was largely due to slower price increases in key sectors such as <a href=\"/statistics/318687/housing-water-and-fuel-inflation-rate-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy</a>, which drove a significant amount of the 2022 wave of inflation. Inflation nevertheless remains elevated, fueled not only by high <a href=\"/statistics/285109/cpi-food-and-drink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">food inflation</a>, but also by underlying <a href=\"/statistics/1317058/uk-core-inflation-rate/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">core inflation</a>. As of February 2025, the overall CPI inflation rate was 2.8 percent, although <a href=\"/statistics/374754/consumer-price-index-cpi-forecast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an uptick in inflation is expected later in the year</a>, with a rate of 3.7 percent forecast for the third quarter of the year.</p>",

    "description": "<p>From 2003 to 2025, the central banks of the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union exhibited remarkably similar interest rate patterns, reflecting shared global economic conditions. In the early 2000s, rates were initially low to stimulate growth, then increased as economies showed signs of overheating prior to 2008. The financial crisis that year prompted sharp rate cuts to near-zero levels, which persisted for an extended period to support economic recovery. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to further rate reductions to historic lows, aiming to mitigate economic fallout. However, surging inflation in 2022 triggered a dramatic policy shift, with the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and European Central Bank significantly raising rates to curb price pressures. As inflation stabilized in late 2023 and early 2024, the ECB and Bank of England initiated rate cuts by mid-2024, and the Federal Reserve also implemented its first cut in three years, with\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/1429525/policy-interest-rates-forecast-in-europe-and-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">forecasts suggesting a gradual decrease in all major interest rates</a> between 2025 and 2026.</p>\n<h2>Divergent approaches within the European Union</h2>\n<p>While the ECB sets a benchmark rate for the Eurozone, individual EU countries have adopted diverse strategies to address their unique economic circumstances. For instance, Hungary set the <a href=\"/statistics/1320828/key-interest-rate-european-union-by-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">highest rate in the EU</a> at 13 percent in September 2023, gradually reducing it to 6.5 percent by October 2024. In contrast, Sweden implemented more aggressive cuts, lowering its rate to 2.25 percent by February 2025, the lowest among EU members. These variations highlight the complex economic landscape that European central banks must navigate, balancing inflation control with economic growth support.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Global context and future outlook</h2>\n<p>The interest rate changes in major economies have had far-reaching effects on global financial markets. Government bond yields, for example, reflect these policy shifts and investor sentiment. As of June 2024, the United States had the highest 10-year <a href=\"/statistics/1211855/ten-year-government-bond-yield-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">government bond yield among developed economies</a> at 4.09 percent, while Switzerland had the lowest at 0.69 percent.

    "description": "<p>The U.S. federal funds effective rate underwent a dramatic reduction in early 2020 in response to the <a href=\"/page/covid-19-coronavirus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The rate plummeted from 1.58 percent in February 2020 to 0.65 percent in March, and further decreased to 0.05 percent in April. This sharp reduction, accompanied by the Federal Reserve's <a href=\"/topics/6441/quantitative-easing-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">quantitative easing program</a>, was implemented to stabilize the economy during the global health crisis. After maintaining historically low rates for nearly two years, the Federal Reserve began a series of rate hikes in early 2022, with the rate moving from 0.33 percent in April 2022 to 5.33 percent in August 2023. The rate remained unchanged for over a year, before the Federal Reserve initiated its first rate cut in nearly three years in September 2024, bringing the rate to 5.13 percent. By December 2024, the rate was cut to 4.48 percent, signaling a shift in monetary policy in the second half of 2024. The first rate cut in 2025 then set the rate at 4.33 percent.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>What is the federal funds effective rate?</h2>\n<p>The U.S. federal funds effective rate determines the interest rate paid by depository institutions, such as banks and credit unions, that lend reserve balances to other depository institutions overnight. Changing the effective rate in times of crisis is a common way to stimulate the economy, as it has a significant impact on the whole economy, such as <a href=\"/statistics/188185/percent-change-from-preceding-period-in-real-gdp-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">economic growth</a>, employment, and <a href=\"/statistics/273418/unadjusted-monthly-inflation-rate-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">inflation</a>.</p>\n<h2>Central bank policy rates</h2>\n<p>The adjustment of interest rates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic was a coordinated global effort. In early 2020, <a href=\"/statistics/1034304/central-bank-policy-rates-advanced-emerging-economies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">central banks worldwide implemented aggressive monetary easing policies</a> to combat the economic crisis. The U.S. Federal Reserve's dramatic reduction of its federal funds rate - from 1.58 percent in February 2020 to 0.05 percent by April - mirrored similar actions taken by central banks globally. While these low rates remained in place throughout 2021, mounting inflationary pressures led to a synchronized tightening cycle beginning in 2022, with central banks pushing rates to multi-year highs. By mid-2024, as inflation moderated across major economies, central banks began implementing their first rate cuts in several years, with the <a href=\"/statistics/1470953/monthy-fed-funds-ecb-boe-interest-rates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. Federal Reserve, Bank of England, and European Central Bank</a> all easing monetary policy.</p>",

By January 2025, the rate dropped to 4.33 percent, signalling a shift in monetary policy.\u00a0</p>\n<h2><b>What is the Federal Reserve interest rate?</b></h2>\n<p>The Federal Reserve interest rate, or the federal funds rate, is the rate at which banks and credit unions lend to and borrow from each other. It is one of the Federal Reserve's key tools for maintaining strong <a href=\"/statistics/192398/employment-rate-in-the-us-since-1990/?locale=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">employment rates</a>, stable prices, and reasonable interest rates. The rate is determined by the Federal Reserve and adjusted eight times a year, though it can be changed through emergency meetings during times of crisis. The Fed doesn't directly control the interest rate but sets a target rate. It then uses open market operations to influence rates toward this target.</p>\n<h2><b>Ways of measuring inflation</b></h2>\n<p>Inflation is typically measured using several methods, with the most common being the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI tracks the price of a fixed basket of goods and services over time, providing a measure of the price changes consumers face. At the end of 2023, the\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/1032274/headline-consumer-price-index-inflation-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPI in the United States</a> was 158.11 percent, up from 153.12 a year earlier.

    "description": "<p>European Union central banks navigated a complex economic landscape between 2022 and 2025, with interest rates initially rising across member states. However, a pivotal shift occurred in late 2023 as most countries began lowering their rates, reflecting the delicate balance between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth. In the Euro area, the <a href=\"/topics/1385/european-central-bank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Central Bank (ECB)</a> led this trend by cutting interest rates from 4.5 percent to 3.15 percent in 2024, implementing four strategic rate reductions throughout the year. This approach was nearly universally adopted, with Poland being the sole EU country not reducing its rates during this period.</p>\n<h2>Global context and policy shifts</h2>\n<p>The interest rate changes in the EU mirror similar movements in other major economies. The United States, United Kingdom, and European Union central banks followed remarkably similar patterns from 2003 to 2024, responding to shared global economic conditions. After maintaining near-zero rates following the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, these institutions sharply raised rates in 2022 to combat surging inflation. By mid-2024, the <a href=\"/statistics/1470953/monthy-fed-funds-ecb-boe-interest-rates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">European Central Bank and Bank of England initiated rate cuts</a>, with the Federal Reserve following suit.</p>\n<h2>Varied approaches within the EU</h2>\n<p>Despite the overall trend, individual EU countries have adopted diverse strategies. Hungary, for instance, set the highest rate in the EU at 13 percent in September 2023, gradually reducing it to 6.5 percent by September 2024. In contrast, Sweden implemented the most aggressive cuts, lowering its rate to 2.25 percent by February 2025, the lowest among EU members.

    "description": "<p>August 2024 marked a significant shift in the UK's monetary policy, as it saw the first reduction in the official bank base interest rate since August 2023. This change came after a period of consistent rate hikes that began in late 2021.\u00a0In a bid to minimize the\u00a0<a href=\"/topics/6139/covid-19-impact-on-the-global-economy/#topicOverview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the Bank of England cut the official bank base rate in March 2020 to a record low of 0.1 percent. This historic low came just one week after the Bank of England cut rates from 0.75 percent to 0.25 percent in a bid to prevent mass job cuts in the United Kingdom. It remained at 0.1 percent until December 2021 and was increased to one percent in May 2022 and to 2.25 percent in October 2022. After that, the bank rate increased almost on a monthly basis, reaching 5.25 percent in August 2023. It wasn't until August 2024 that the first rate decrease since the previous year occurred, signaling a potential shift in monetary policy.</p>\n<h2>Why do central banks adjust interest rates?</h2>\n<p>Central banks, including the Bank of England, adjust interest rates to manage economic stability and <a href=\"/statistics/1317878/inflation-rate-interest-rate-by-country/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">control inflation</a>. Their strategies involve a delicate balance between two main approaches. When central banks raise interest rates, their goal is to cool down an overheated economy. Higher rates curb excessive spending and borrowing, which helps to prevent runaway inflation. This approach is typically used when the economy is growing too quickly or when inflation is rising above desired levels. Conversely, when central banks lower interest rates, they aim to encourage borrowing and investment. This strategy is employed to stimulate economic growth during periods of slowdown or recession. Lower rates make it cheaper for businesses and individuals to borrow money, which can lead to increased spending and investment. This dual approach allows central banks to maintain a balance between promoting growth and controlling inflation, ensuring long-term economic stability. Additionally, adjusting interest rates can influence currency values, impacting international trade and investment flows, further underscoring their critical role in a nation's economic health.</p>\n<h2>Recent interest rate trends</h2>\n<p>Between 2021 and 2024, most advanced and emerging economies experienced a <a href=\"/statistics/1034304/central-bank-policy-rates-advanced-emerging-economies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">period of regular interest rate hikes</a>. This trend was driven by several factors, including persistent supply chain disruptions, high energy prices, and robust demand pressures. These elements combined to create significant inflationary trends, prompting central banks to raise rates in an effort to temper spending and borrowing. However, in 2024, a shift began to occur in global monetary policy. The European Central Bank (ECB) was among the first major central banks to reverse this trend by <a href=\"/statistics/621489/fluctuation-of-fixed-rate-interest-rates-ecb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cutting interest rates</a>. This move signaled a change in approach aimed at addressing growing economic slowdowns and supporting growth.\u00a0</p>",

Far behind was <em>The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021), </em>China's most expensive film ever made to date, with about 5.8 billion yuan in box office revenue.\u00a0<em>Avengers: Endgame (2019)</em> was the only foreign film in the top ten ranking. The Marvel superhero film generated a total box office revenue of over 4.25 billion yuan in China.

Hollywood productions, like\u00a0<em>Avatar, Deadpool, The Da Vinci Code,</em> were banned because of sensitive topics or conveying ideologies contradictory to traditional Chinese values.

Since returning to power, support for the Labour Party has fallen considerably, with the government's sinking <a href=\"/statistics/1167064/uk-government-approval-rating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">approval rating</a> approaching the unpopularity of the previous government.\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Labour's return to power in 2024</h2>\n<p>On May 22, 2024, Rishi Sunak announced his decision to hold the <a href=\"/topics/11880/uk-general-election-2024/#topicOverview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2024 general election</a> on July 4. Sunak's surprise announcement came shortly after some positive\u00a0<a href=\"/topics/6500/the-british-economy/#topicOverview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">economic </a>figures were released in the UK, and he may have hoped this would boost his poor\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/710316/prime-minister-voting-intention-in-great-britain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">job ratings</a> and perhaps also his government's low approval ratings. This was a long-shot, however, and as predicted in the polls, Labour won the 2024 general election by a landslide, winning 412 out of 650 <a href=\"/statistics/1441451/uk-projected-election-results/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seats</a>. The sting in the tale for the Labour Party was that despite this large majority, they won a relatively <a href=\"/statistics/1478478/uk-election-results-by-vote-share/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">low share</a> of the votes and almost immediately saw their popularity fall in the second half of 2024.\u00a0  </p>\n<h2>Sunak's five pledges in 2023</h2>\n<p>After a tough 2022, in which Britain suffered through its worst cost of living crisis in a generation, the economy was consistently identified as the <a href=\"/statistics/886366/issues-facing-britain/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">main issue facing the country</a>, just ahead of healthcare. To respond to these concerns, Rishi Sunak started 2023 with five pledges; halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce national debt, cut NHS waiting times, and stop small boats. By the end of that year, just one pledge can be said to have been fully realized, with\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/306648/inflation-rate-consumer-price-index-cpi-united-kingdom-uk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CPI inflation</a> falling from 10.1 percent at the start of 2023 to four percent by the end of it. There is some ambiguity regarding the success of some of the other pledges. The <a href=\"/statistics/970941/quarterly-gdp-growth-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">economy shrank</a> in the last two quarters of 2023 but started to grow again in early 2024. National<a href=\"/statistics/282841/debt-as-gdp-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\u00a0debt</a> increased slightly, while <a href=\"/statistics/1171253/migrant-channel-crossings-in-the-uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">small boat arrivals</a> declined compared to 2022, but were still higher than in most other years. The pledge to cut <a href=\"/statistics/986875/waiting-times-for-elective-treatment-in-england/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NHS waiting times</a> was not fulfilled either, with the number of people awaiting treatment rising in 2023.</p>",

    "description": "<p>In the aftermath of the German Federal Election of 2025, the CDU were polling at around 26 percent of the vote as of April 11, 2025, with the party receiving 28.5 percent of the vote in the election held the previous month.\u00a0</p>\n<h2><strong>The Ampel's woes continue in 2024\u00a0</strong></h2>\n<p>The Ampel coalition came to power in 2021 due to the surprise surge in support for the <a href=\"/statistics/957247/spd-membership-development-germany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Social Democrats</a>, who secured almost 26 percent of the vote in that election. Unwilling to re-enter a 'grand coalition' with the Christian Democrats, the SPD instead opted to create a coalition with the center-left environmentalist party, the <a href=\"/statistics/957296/green-party-membership-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Greens</a>, and the free-market neoliberal party, the <a href=\"/statistics/957348/fdp-party-membership-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FDP</a>. This unlikely coalition which promised to \"dare to make more progress\" (<em>mehr Fortschritt wagen</em>) has instead been mired by constant infighting between the three parties, as well as being hit by several external crises, most notably <a href=\"/topics/9087/russia-ukraine-war-2022/#topicOverview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine</a>. At the same time, the <a href=\"/statistics/375203/gross-domestic-product-gdp-growth-rate-in-germany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">German economy</a>'s post-pandemic recovery has faltered, with the country being one of the few European countries to experience a <a href=\"/statistics/686147/gdp-growth-europe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recession in 2023</a>, while one of the government's key economic plans - a special investment fund designed to bypass the constitutional <a href=\"/statistics/1034357/gross-government-debt-as-a-share-of-gdp-in-advanced-economies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">debt</a> brake - was struck down by the constitutional court in Karlsruhe.\u00a0  These factors have led to consistently declining support for the three governing parties, with the latest poll showing their combined share of the vote being only 33 percent, slightly more than the vote share of the Christian Democrats. While the Greens' vote share would remain roughly equal to what they achieved in 2021, the popularity of the SPD and FDP has collapsed compared to their 2021 levels. The Social Democrats are now the third most popular party in Germany, with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's party on track to achieve their worst election result since 1887. The Liberals (FDP), on the other hand, look likely to not gain any seats in the parliament at all in the next election, as they are currently falling below the five percent threshold to enter the\u00a0<em>Bundestag\u00a0</em>(federal parliament).\u00a0</p>\n<h2><strong>The rise of the far-right in German politics</strong></h2>\n<p>The Ampel's loss has been the <a href=\"/topics/5147/right-wing-populism-and-nationalism-in-germany/#topicOverview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">far-right</a>'s gain, as the <a href=\"/statistics/957361/afd-party-membership-development/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alternative for Germany</a> (AfD) party has seen its fortunes rise consistently in opinion polls since the 2021 election. The party was originally founded to oppose plans for the EU to provide bailouts to struggling member states during the <a href=\"/statistics/1378661/government-debt-eu-gdp-ratio-select-countries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eurozone debt crisis</a> in the early 2010s, however, following the <a href=\"/statistics/911527/number-first-asylum-applications-germany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2015 Syrian refugee crisis</a> the party pivoted towards a hardline anti-immigration stance. Since then, the AfD has drifted consistently to the right, with one of the dominant factions, known as <em>Der Fl\u00fcgel\u00a0</em>(\"the wing\"), being labelled far-right extremists and even, in some cases, fascists. While the federal-level party is currently led by Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupulla, members of the more moderate faction of the party, at the regional-level the party is often led by more extreme figures, such as in the state of Thuringia where party leader Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke has been labelled in the media as a far-right extremist.\u00a0  In January 2024, an article by investigative journalists brought to light secret meetings between AfD members and far-right supporters to discuss plans for mass deportations of foreigners from Germany, were the AfD to come to power. The scandal led to the largest street protests in the country so far this century, with estimates showing as many as 1.4 million people turning out across the country. Some protesters have even gone so far as to call for a <a href=\"/statistics/959446/opinions-afd-threat-to-democracy-germany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">constitutional ban</a> against the AfD, claiming that they pose a threat to German democracy. The party suffered a drop in support in the aftermath of the scandal, with their share of prospective voters declining by four percent from their high-point in January of 2024. The Alternative for Germany currently is the party of choice for 18 percent of German voters, which would make them the second largest party in parliament after the Christian Democrats. While no other party currently says they would work with the AfD on a national level, this <em>Brandmauer\u00a0</em>(\"fire wall\") may be tested in regional parliaments during 2024, as the party looks set to come first in several states in East Germany during the year.\u00a0</p>",

In 1972, due to geopolitical conflict, OPEC set an oil embargo and cut oil production, causing prices to quadruple by 1974. Oil prices rose again in 1979 and 1980 due to the Iranian revolution, and doubled between 1978 and 1981 as the Iran-Iraq War prevented oil production.

It was founded in 1960 in Baghdad, Iraq.   </p>\n<h2>The OPEC Reference Basket</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"/statistics/277914/monthly-average-prices-of-the-opec-crude-oil-basket/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OPEC crude oil price</a> is defined by the price of the so-called OPEC (Reference) basket. This basket is an average of prices of the various petroleum blends that are produced by the OPEC members. Some of these oil blends are, for example: Saharan Blend from Algeria, Basra Light from Iraq, Arab Light from Saudi Arabia, BCF 17 from Venezuela, et cetera. By increasing and decreasing its oil production, OPEC tries to keep the price between a given maxima and minima.\u00a0  </p>\n<h2>Benchmark crude oil</h2>\n<p>The OPEC basket is one of the most important benchmarks for crude oil prices worldwide. Other significant benchmarks are <a href=\"/statistics/209641/average-annual-spot-price-of-wti-and-brent-crude-oil/\">UK Brent, West Texas Intermediate (WTI)</a>, and Dubai Crude (Fateh). Because there are many types and grades of oil, such benchmarks are indispensable for referencing them on the global oil market. The 2024 fall in prices was the result of weakened demand outlooks, primarily from China.</p>",

Between September 2022 and March 2023, the UK experienced seven months of double-digit inflation, which peaked at 11.1 percent in October 2022. Due to this long period of high inflation, UK\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/306631/consumer-price-index-cpi-united-kingdom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">consumer prices </a>have increased by over 20 percent in the last three years.

In December 2024, for example, 56 percent of UK households reported their <a href=\"/statistics/1300280/great-britain-cost-of-living-increase/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cost of living was increasing</a> compared with the previous month, up from 45 percent in July, but far lower than at the height of the crisis in 2022. After global energy prices spiraled that year, the UK's <a href=\"/chart/28131/uk-energy-price-cap-timeline/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy price cap</a> increased substantially. The cap, which limits what suppliers can charge consumers, reached 3,549 British pounds per year in October 2022, compared with 1,277 pounds a year earlier. Along with soaring food costs, high-energy bills have hit UK <a href=\"/statistics/379934/household-expenditure-categories-uk-by-decile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">households</a> hard, especially lower income ones that spend more of their earnings on housing costs.\u00a0 As a result of these factors, UK households experienced their biggest <a href=\"/statistics/1070120/real-household-disposable-income-per-capita-change-forecast-united-kingdom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">fall in living standards</a> in decades in 2022/23.  </p>\n<h2>Global inflation crisis causes rapid surge in prices</h2>\n<p>The UK's high inflation, and cost of living crisis in 2022 had its origins in the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the initial waves of the virus, <a href=\"/statistics/1315308/global-supply-chain-pressure-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">global supply chains</a> struggled to meet the renewed demand for goods and services. <a href=\"/statistics/1111134/monthly-food-price-index-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Food</a> and\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/1302801/monthly-fuel-energy-price-index-worldwide/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">energy</a> prices, which were already high, increased further in 2022. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 brought an end to the era of cheap gas flowing to European markets from Russia. The war also disrupted global food markets, as both Russia and Ukraine are major exporters of cereal crops. As a result of these factors, inflation surged across\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/225698/monthly-inflation-rate-in-eu-countries/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Europe </a>and in other parts of the world, but typically declined in 2023, and approached more usual levels by 2024.\u00a0\u00a0</p>",

GDP refers to the total market value of all goods and services that are produced within a country per year. It is an important indicator of the economic strength of a country.

Since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978, the country has experienced rapid social and economic development. In 2013, it became the world\u2019s largest trading nation, overtaking the United States. However, <a href=\"/statistics/263775/gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita-in-china/\">per capita GDP in China</a> was still much lower than that of <a href=\"/statistics/256427/gdp-per-capita-in-the-main-industrialized-and-emerging-countries/\">industrialized countries</a>. Until 2011, the <a href=\"/statistics/263616/gross-domestic-product-gdp-growth-rate-in-china/\">annual growth rate of China\u2019s GDP</a> had constantly been above nine percent. However, economic growth has cooled down since and is projected to further slow down gradually in the future. Rising domestic wages and the competitive edge of other Asian and African countries are seen as main reasons for the stuttering in China\u2019s economic engine. One strategy of the Chinese government to overcome this transition is a gradual shift of <a href=\"/statistics/270325/distribution-of-gross-domestic-product-gdp-across-economic-sectors-in-china/\">economic focus from industrial production to services</a>.   </p>\n<h2>Challenges to GDP growth</h2>\n<p>Another major challenge lies in the massive environmental pollution that China\u2019s reckless economic growth has caused over the past decades. China\u2019s development has been powered mostly by <a href=\"/statistics/278669/energy-consumption-in-china-by-source/\">coal consumption</a>, which resulted in high air pollution. To counteract industrial pollution, further investments in waste management and clean technologies are necessary. In 2017, about 1.15 percent of GDP was <a href=\"/statistics/300438/china-pollution-treatment-investment-as-percentage-of-gdp/\">spent on pollution control</a>. Surging environmental costs aside, environmental issues could also be a key to industrial transition as China placed major investments in renewable energy and clean tech projects. The <a href=\"/statistics/274058/renewable-energy-consumption-in-china/\">consumption of green energy</a> skyrocketed from 0.52 exajoules in 2005 to 13.3 million in 2022.</p>",

    "description": "<p>As of April 16, 2025, the yield for a ten-year U.S. government bond was 4.34 percent, while the yield for a two-year bond was 3.86 percent. This represents an inverted yield curve, whereby bonds of longer maturities provide a lower yield, reflecting investors' expectations for a decline in long-term interest rates. Hence, making long-term debt holders open to more risk under the uncertainty around the condition of financial markets in the future. That markets are uncertain can be seen by considering both the short-term fluctuations, and the long-term downward trend, of the\u00a0<a href=\"/statistics/1059669/yield-curve-usa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">yields of U.S. government bonds from 2006 to 2021</a>, before the treasury yield curve increased again significantly in the following years.  </p>\n<h2>What are government bonds?</h2>\n<p>Government bonds, otherwise called \u2018sovereign\u2019 or \u2018treasury\u2019 bonds, are financial instruments used by governments to raise money for government spending. Investors give the government a certain amount of money (the \u2018face value\u2019), to be repaid at a specified time in the future (the \u2018maturity date\u2019). In addition, the government makes regular periodic interest payments (called \u2018coupon payments\u2019). Once initially issued, government bonds are tradable on financial markets, meaning their value can fluctuate over time (even though the underlying face value and coupon payments remain the same). Investors are attracted to government bonds as, provided the country in question has a stable economy and political system, they are a very safe investment. Accordingly, in periods of economic turmoil, investors may be willing to accept a negative overall return in order to have a safe haven for their money. For example, once the market value is compared to the total received from remaining interest payments and the face value, investors have been willing to accept a negative <a href=\"/statistics/1203409/two-year-treasury-note-yield-germany/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">return on two-year German government bonds</a> between 2014 and 2021. Conversely, if the underlying economy and political structures are weak, investors demand a higher return to compensate for the higher risk they take on. Consequently, <a href=\"/statistics/1086539/emerging-markets-bond-index-brazil/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the return on bonds in emerging markets like Brazil</a> are consistently higher than that of the United States (and other developed economies).  </p>\n<h2>Inverted yield curves</h2>\n<p>When investors are worried about the financial future, it can lead to what is called an \u2018inverted yield curve\u2019. An inverted yield curve is where investors pay more for short term bonds than long term, indicating they do not have confidence in long-term financial conditions. Historically, the yield curve has historically inverted before each of the last five <a href=\"/study/74904/the-next-recession-in-the-us/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. recessions</a>. The last <a href=\"/statistics/1039451/us-government-bonds-ten-minus-two-year-yield-spread/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">U.S. yield curve inversion</a> occurred at several brief points in 2019 \u2013 a trend which continued until the Federal Reserve cut interest rates several times over that year. However, the ultimate trigger for the next recession was the unpredicted, exogenous shock of the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, showing how such informal indicators may be grounded just as much in coincidence as causation.</p>",

The use of surveys was initiated to get a more accurate picture of actual unemployment in urban areas of China. The surveys cover all permanent residents between the age of 16 and retirement age living in cities. In contrast, registered unemployment figures take only those people into account that have actively reported their unemployment.

As of April 22, 2025, one Litcoin token was worth 83.41 U.S. dollars. Litecoin's price was relatively volatile in recent years, revealing high price swings between months.  <h2>What is a cryptocurrency?</h2>Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that do not have a centralized regulating authority. The first of these, Bitcoin, introduced a technology called <a href='/topics/5122/blockchain/' target='_blank'>blockchain</a>, in which a distributed ledger records every transaction on every bitcoin in circulation to prevent fraud. Litecoin also uses this technology. To accommodate the demands of constant ledger updates, users sell computational power in exchange for an amount of Litecoin, a process known as <a href='/statistics/731449/geographical-distribution-of-mining-pools/' target='_blank'>mining</a>.  <h2>More about Litecoin</h2>Cryptocurrencies are still emerging technology, and few are using them for transactions. As such, most users are speculators who look at the value of all coins in circulation as the <a href='/statistics/807173/litecoin-market-capitalization-quarterly/' target='_blank'>market capitalization</a> rather than money supply. Still, the average <a href='/statistics/730833/average-number-of-litecoin-transactions/' target='_blank'>number of Litecoin transactions</a> ranges in the tens of thousands, meaning that the cryptocurrency has a substantial financial footprint.",

    "description": "The price of the native coin from BNB Chain (formerly BSC) grew by 50 percent in late 2021 but was much lower in 2022. In April 22, 2025, for example, a single BNB coin was worth more than 618.83 U.S. dollars - a value that very different to the all-time high of 600 U.S. dollars in November 2021. Regardless, Binance Coin ranked in the top 10 <a href='/statistics/655492/most-valuable-virtual-currencies-globally/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>most expensive cryptocurrencies</a> in 2022. Noticeable is that the price increase of BNB in November 2021 coincides with a similar <a href='/statistics/806453/price-of-ethereum/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>price change for Ethereum (ETH)</a> - a cryptocurrency where BNB initially originated in 2017 before coming on its own years later.  <h2>BNB\u2019s history: From reward token in 2017 to an ecosystem after 2019</h2>As the name suggests, Binance Coin or BNB originally started as an extension of the Binance.com trading platform - the <a href='/statistics/864738/leading-cryptocurrency-exchanges-traders/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>most used cryptocurrency exchange in the world</a>. It initially functioned on the Ethereum blockchain network as an ERC-20 token, offering incentives to owners like reduced trading fees, affiliate rewards, or a lottery ticket system (\u201cLaunchpad\u201d) that let users invest in new, Binance-selected crypto projects. In 2019, however, BNB moved away from the Ethereum network and migrated to Binance\u2019s self-developed blockchain: Binance Smart Chain or BSC (called BNB Chain since February 2022). Here, BNB started to support a chain that initially did not focus on hosting decentralized apps but focused on high transaction speed and being able to handle large amounts of traffic.  <h2>DeFi and GameFi: the main segments for BNB</h2>BSC, however, made significant strides in 2021 partly due to traffic overload and high gas prices on Ethereum as well as the growing interest in both Decentralized Finance (DeFI) and NFTs. Much like Cardano, Solana, and Terra, Binance Smart Chain consequently became a valid alternative to Ethereum: <a href='/statistics/1263975/ethereum-binance-share-in-defi-tvl/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>The total value locked (TVL) of BNBs blockchain within DeFi</a>, for example, ranked only behind that of Terra and Ethereum in early 2022. Another area where Binance\u2019s blockchain and token play a significant role is that of GameFi - or \u201cplay-to-earn\u201d blockchain games that are powered by cryptocurrencies. Some of the more well-known and <a href='/statistics/1266486/blockchain-games-user-number/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>most popular NFT games</a> like Alien Worlds and Axie Infinity run on the blockchain behind BNB.",

    "description": "Ripple - or XRP - prices surged in 2021, but went down significantly as 2022 progressed. As of April 22, 2025, one XRP token was worth 2.22 U.S. dollars. <a href='/statistics/806453/price-of-ethereum/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Ethereum's price</a>, for example, kept on reaching new all-time highs, a feat not performed by XRP. Indeed, XRP's more price spikes followed relatively late - only occurring in early 2021, against late 2020 for most other cryptos - after the US SEC filed a legal complaint against Ripple in November 2020. This legal action caused the XRP price to plummet from around 0.70 U.S. dollars to 0.20 U.S. dollars.  <h2>Ripple versus XRP: two become one</h2>Technically speaking, Ripple is not a cryptocurrency. Renamed from a protocol called OpenCoin in 2013, Ripple facilitates open-source payments. XRP, on the other hand, is the cryptocurrency that runs on this network. In that sense, Ripple and XRP have a similar symbiosis to each other like the Ethereum network and its cryptocurrency Ether. Unlike Ethereum - whose price changes are connected to the world of Decentralized Finance or DeFI - Ripple/XRP mostly looks at developments on cross-border payments for companies. In 2020, <a href='/statistics/1084937/future-usage-fintech-vs-bank-payment-solutions-companies-global/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>companies worldwide began to favor fintech solutions for future B2B solutions</a> and, in a way, Ripple is an extension of that.  <h2>What affects the price of Ripple?</h2>Ripple is mostly active in Southeast Asia - a region with a splintered payment landscape and that <a href='/statistics/1229776/countries-with-most-mature-interbank-cbdg-worldwide/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>heavily investigates its own types of state-issued cryptocurrency</a> to make cross-border payments a lot easier. Price spikes tend to follow after news on this topic in this specific region. In 2019, for example, the XRP price grew after Japan and South Korea began testing to reduce time and costs for transferring international funds between the two countries. In March 2021, Ripple announced that it had agreed to acquire 40 percent of Malaysian cross-border payments firm Tranglo to meet growing demand in Southeast Asia.",

    "description": "Ethereum's price history suggests that that crypto was worth significantly less in 2022 than during late 2021, although nowhere near the lowest price recorded. Much like Bitcoin (BTC), the price of ETH went up in 2021 but for different reasons altogether: Ethereum, for instance, hit the news when a digital art piece was sold as <a href='/statistics/1222113/top-nft-projects-worldwide/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>the world\u2019s most expensive NFT</a> for over 38,000 ETH - or 69.3 million U.S. dollars. Unlike Bitcoin - of which the price growth was fueled by the IPO of the U.S.\u2019 biggest crypto trader Coinbase - the rally on Ethereum came from technological developments that caused much excitement among traders. First, the so-called \u201cBerlin update\u201d rolled out on the Ethereum network in April 2021, an update which would eventually lead to the Ethereum Merge in 2022 and reduced <a href='/statistics/1221821/gas-price-ethereum/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>ETH gas prices - or reduced transaction fees</a>. The collapse of FTX in late 2022, however, changed much for the cryptocurrency. As of April 22, 2025, Ethereum was worth 1,757.33 U.S. dollars - significantly less than the 4,400 U.S. dollars by the end of 2021.  <h2>Ethereum\u2019s future and the DeFi industry</h2> Price developments on Ethereum are difficult to predict, but cannot be seen without the world of DeFi - or Decentralized Finance. This industry used technology to remove intermediaries between parties in a financial transaction. One example includes <a href='/statistics/1206516/global-cryptocurrency-app-downloads/ ' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>crypto wallets such as Coinbase Wallet that grew in popularity in recent years</a>, with other examples including smart contractor Uniswap, Maker (responsible for stablecoin DAI), money lender Dharma and market protocol Compound. Ethereum\u2019s future developments are tied with this industry: Unlike Bitcoin and Ripple, Ethereum is technically not a currency but an open-source software platform for blockchain applications - with Ether being the cryptocurrency that is used inside the Ethereum network. Essentially, Ethereum facilitates DeFi - meaning that if DeFi does well, so does Ethereum.  <h2>NFTs: the most well-known application of Ethereum</h2>NFTs or non-fungible tokens grew nearly ten-fold between 2018 and 2020, as can be seen in <a href='/statistics/1221742/nft-market-capitalization-worldwide/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>the market cap of NFTs worldwide</a>. These digital blockchain assets can essentially function as a unique code connected to a digital file, allowing to distinguish the original file from any potential copies. This application is especially prominent in crypto art, although there are other applications: gaming, sports and collectibles are <a href='/statistics/1221400/nft-sales-revenue-by-segment/ ' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>other segments where NFT sales occur</a>.",

That particular price hike was connected to the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States, whilst previous hikes in 2021 were due to events involving Tesla and Coinbase, respectively. Tesla\u2019s announcement in March 2021 that it had acquired 1.5 billion U.S. dollars\u2019 worth of the digital coin, for example, as well as <a href='/topics/7759/coinbase-ipo/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>the IPO of the U.S.\u2019 biggest crypto exchange</a> fueled mass interest. The market was noticably different by the end of 2022, however, with Bitcoin prices reaching roughly 93,441.89 as of April 22, 2025 after another crypto exchange, FTX, filed for bankruptcy.  <h2>Is the world running out of Bitcoin?</h2>Unlike fiat currency like the U.S. dollar - as the Federal Reserve can simply decide to print more banknotes - Bitcoin\u2019s supply is finite: <a href='/statistics/802775/worldwide-cryptocurrency-maximum-supply/ ' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>BTC has a maximum supply embedded in its design</a>, of which roughly 89 percent had been reached in April 2021. It is believed that Bitcoin will run out by 2040, despite more powerful mining equipment. This is because mining becomes exponentially more difficult and power-hungry every four years, a part of Bitcoin\u2019s original design. Because of this, <a href='/statistics/881522/bitcoin-energy-consumption-relative-to-select-countries/ ' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>a Bitcoin mining transaction could equal the energy consumption of a small country</a> in 2021.  <h2>Bitcoin\u2019s price outlook: a potential bubble?</h2>Cryptocurrencies have few metrices available that allow for forecasting, if only because it is rumored that only few cryptocurrency holders own a large portion of available supply. These large holders - referred to as \u201cwhales\u201d - are said to make up of two percent of anonymous ownership accounts, whilst owning roughly 92 percent of BTC. On top of this, <a href='/statistics/1222954/crypto-customer-base-type-region/ ' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>most people who use cryptocurrency-related services worldwide are retail clients</a> rather than institutional investors.

The collapse of crypto trader FTX in 2022 especially impacted the cryptocurrency, as FTX and its sister firm Alameda Research sold a large amount of the coin in order to avoid bankruptcy. The Solana protocol is similar to Ethereum in that can allow for nun-fungible tokens to be created ('minted') or traded. Solana, however, uses a technology called 'PoH' or Proof of History, which allows it to reach high transaction speeds. The Solana Foundation - the creators of the protocol, based in Switzerland - claims they could reach up to 65,000 transactions per second compared to 16 for Ethereum. Additionally, Solano had no transaction fees or 'gas', unlike <a href='/statistics/1221821/gas-price-ethereum/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Ethereum, which had growing transaction costs</a>.

The average UK consumer also feels the pinch as <a href='/statistics/306631/inflation-rate-consumer-price-index-cpi-united-kingdom-uk-y-on-y/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>inflation rates</a> often rise to cover the shortfall of the pound. When the inflation rate rises, the price of imported goods goes up and the consumer ends up paying more.   <h2>GBP to U.S. dollar</h2>Since 2016\u2019s referendum, the British pound (GBP) fell across the exchange. The GBP's fall against the Euro was also reflected against the <a href='/statistics/1034406/monthly-exchange-rate-gbp-usd-worldwide/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>U.S. dollar </a>where the exchange rate in May 2016 (pre-referendum) of 1.46 dollars to the pound has fallen significantly.",

This according to a comparison between average monthly and daily exchange rates. Figures changed especially in the second half of 2022, after the British government first announced its inflation plans. By April 22, 2025, however, one euro was valued at 0.86 British pounds. The <a href='/statistics/1034391/monthly-exchange-rate-gbp-eur-worldwide/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>pound to euro exchange rate</a> can be found on a different page.  <h2>Establishment</h2>The euro, which was established in 1992, introduced in non-physical form in 1999 and finally rolled out in 2002, is used by 19 of the 27 member states of the European Union. This group of 19 countries is otherwise known as the eurozone or euro area. By 2018, the total value of euro <a href='/statistics/442970/currency-in-circulation-euro-area/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>currency in circulation</a> was almost 1.2 trillion euros, or over <a href='/statistics/443000/per-capita-currency-in-circulation-euro-area/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>3.4 thousand</a> euros per capita.  <h2>Euro to GBP</h2>Between 2000 and 2009, the average annual exchange rate of the euro to the British pound sterling noted a steep increase. In 2009, the euro to British pound sterling annual average exchange rate was equal to 0.89, which meant that one euro could buy 0.89 British pounds. By 2016, this value had decreased to a value of 0.82, which again meant that one euro could buy 0.88 British pounds. The Brexit referendum is the likely reason for the noted increase in value of euro to British pound sterling from 2017 onwards. The overall strengthening of the euro against the British pound following the referendum result, in June 2016, can be seen in the <a href='/statistics/438077/euro-to-british-pound-monthly-exchange-rate/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>monthly exchange rate</a>.",
